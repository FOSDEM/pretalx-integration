# FOSDEM pretalx integration

For edition 2024 of FOSDEM, we have switched to using [pretalx](https://github.com/pretalx/) instead of pentabarf.

This repository is the home of plugins and scripts we use to customize pretalx.

It contains two plugins:
* auditlog
  * this plugin keeps a log of changes
* devroom-settings: (which should probably renamed to pretalx-fosdem)
